*Kuka mobile robot simulation in vrep.*

The youBot is a mobile robotic arm developed by KUKA. Its arm has five degrees of freedom and a linear gripper. Its base has four Mecanum wheels allowing for omnidirectional movement. These wheels are efficiently modeled using asymmetric friction. in this simulation, we use this robot to perform task of moving boxes of different colors from one position to the target location, The script was written in Luo language.
